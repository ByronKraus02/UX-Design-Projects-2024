Project 1 Part 1:
For this project we were tasked with improving the look and functionality of news24 and presenting it with low fidelity wireframes, in a group of two (consiting of myself and Gina Du Toit) we decdied to fix it by removing the large ads on the side of the screen as well as by fixing the search function for better funciontality.

Project 1 Part 2:
Part two consited of recreating a website with a medium fidelity wireframe, we decided to use Netflix's site and showed the process of choosing a movie, in a four step process where we showed the main screen, then the screen when you hover over a movie, then when you click on a movie for more information and finally when you open the movie.

Project 2 Part 1:
Project two is a website we created called "The Trailblazers". For this project we used medium fidelity wireframes to create an applying function for a website based around running races under a group of runners. We created five pages, 1: the home page, 2: The different locations for the home page. 3: The membership page. 4: The personal details and payment page, 5: the welcome page once you join!

Project 2 Part 2:
Part 2 shows a high fidelity wireframe we created to improve Butlers website. This wireframe is interactive and allows you to search through the pizzas, move to the menu, choose how many pizzas you want and search for specific types of pizzas.

Project 3:
For Project three we needed to show 3 different processes different users have with an app, our app we decided to use is Airbnb. We showed the features for a customer, business or host. The customer is able
to open the main homepage, where she picks the house she is interested in, she then sees the details of the place, and is able to reserve it by choosing the nights she wants to be there for and is then able to see the final page details. The business perspective is for someone who wants to travel thorugh work, his wireframes show how you can go to your profile, choose travel for work, put in your work email and then be able to travel through work, avoiding you paying directly from your money and requesting back from your job. The final wireframes show how a host operates on the app, they are able to go to their chat, there they can go through the conversations they have had with mark who is renitng their place, they can also go to their calendar and look at what dates are available.

Sprint:
For this task, we were in teams of three, myself, Gina du Toit and Jeremy Beyleveld. Our team was tasked with designing a project overview dashboard for a consulting company that manages multiple client projects. The dashboard needed to provide real-time tracking of project metrics such as progress, planning, budget, and profitability. Using Google Material Design principles, we developed wireframes to showcase an interface that allows users to see all projects at a glance, primarily using client logos. Additionally, the dashboard included color-coded profitability indicators to flag projects for review based on key milestones or declining profitability. Our design sprint focused on creating an accessible, intuitive layout for both management and project leads, integrating real-time data from SaaS tools like Harvest, Forecast, and XERO for optimal project tracking.

For each project we were only given 5 days, making the time constraints tight.
